This project is my first 2D game made in Unity with use of C# language. Main theme of the game is to make it as hard as possible to finish, so the player quits out of rage sooner than finishing the game. There are multiple types of traps and enemies, some visible some not. Every level is winable even though it might seem like it's not sometimes. Player starts with 5 lives, each death takes one heart down. So far game has 1 color theme (1 chapter) which contains 5 levels with various obstacles. There are no checkpoints, if you lose all 5 lives you have to start from the beggining of the game again. Game also has standard settings screen with Volume control, graphics control, resolution and fullscreen toggle.
